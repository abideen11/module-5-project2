Yoon: A platform that enables users to lend microloan to aspiring and budding entrepreneurs in developing countries.

The platform works by the user signing up to be a lender, after their credentials have been validated, they will be directed to the page that list all entrepreneurs. Each entrepreneur has five attributes on the entrepreneur, they are name, continent, country, reason for the loan and loan amount. At that page, the lender can choose which entrepreneur they want to loan to. After picking, they will be directed to that entrepreneur's own page, where they will enter the amount they want to loan and the duration of the loan. The lender can only enter an amount that is less than or equal the amount the entrepreneur is seeking. If not, the "Accept" button will be disabled.
